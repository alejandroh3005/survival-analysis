## BIOST 537: Survival Data Analysis In Epidemiology

Taught by Dr. Ting Ye at the University of Washington (Winter 2025)

**In most human studies conducted in the biomedical sciences, the outcome of interest is not observed on all
study participants for a variety of reasons, including patient drop-out or resource limitations. The broad goal
of survival analysis is to address scientific queries about a time-to-event distribution while appropriately
accounting for the data incompleteness that often characterizes biomedical data. This course covers the
foundations of survival analysis, with a particular emphasis on topics relevant to epidemiology, public health
and medicine. The focus of the course is on nonparametric and semiparametric techniques although common
parametric approaches are also discussed. A substantial portion of the course is devoted to the multivariable
analysis of survival outcome data, where multiplicative models are emphasized.**
